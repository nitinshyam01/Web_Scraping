       "[\"As we step into 2024, big changes are happening in the EV industry and the electrification of transportation. Electric vehicle trends for 2024 include lower electric car prices, an expansion of EV charging stations, and greater EV charging plug compatibility. Read on to learn about EV industry trends and how they're shaping the future of the electric vehicle market in the coming year.\",\n",
       " 'Sales are expected to keep growing in 2024, despite some reports suggesting a decline in 2023. Even though more EVs are sitting unsold at dealerships, the actual electric car sales numbers are still strong and their market share is growing.There will be nearly 1.9 million EV sales in the U.S. in 2024, according to projections.',\n",
       " 'The third quarter of 2023 showed the best market growth in EV sales since late 2021, and by September, over 1 million new EVs were sold in 2023. Though EV sales estimates for 2024were adjusted down a bit, they still predict a 20% increase from 2023. Cox Automotive also thinks that in 2024, more than 10% of all vehicle sales will be electric, and when including hybrid vehicles, almost 24% of 2024 vehicle sales will be electric or hybrid.',\n",
       " 'EV sales in 2024 are expected to be highest in China, followed by Europe, North America, South Korea, and Japan. In fact, six out of every ten EV sales globally are from China, where intensifying competition is driving down costs and manufacturer profits. Historically, EV sales have increased annually, and this trend is expected to continue throughout 2024. ',\n",
       " \"There are numerous EVs available for under $40,000in 2024, especially after applying the federal EV tax credit. Although some car shoppers are priced out of the EV market, prices of electric passenger cars will continue to decrease for some models due to technology advancements. For example, as automakers enhance their battery technologies and formulations, it's anticipated that EV battery prices will decrease.\",\n",
       " 'This improvement allows for both extended battery ranges and reduced costs. Considering that batteries make up around 40% of an EV’s total cost, reducing battery expenses is likely to significantly decrease the overall price of EVs, contributing to increased electric car sales. Thus, increasing affordability is an important electric vehicle industry trend for 2024.',\n",
       " 'Indeed EV charging station infrastructure isn’t evenly distributed across the U.S., and California leads the way in the amount of EV charging stations, with more than 10,000 DC fast chargers. Yet, studies showthat many Americans are wary of buying an EV due to charging issues.',\n",
       " '“Consumers need access to safe, reliable, convenient and affordable charging to drive and own an EV, and our research shows real concerns remain,” said Marc Coltelli, EY Americas eMobility Energy Leader. “At the EY organization, we are predicting 82 million EVs will be on US roads by 2035. To scale adoption, the challenge confronting America’s transition to EVs is instilling charging confidence among consumers. The energy industry has a massive role to play in this transition and is seizing the opportunity by collaborating cross-sector to build and power a resilient EV charging network.”',\n",
